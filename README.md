Using APIs: 
- like a converter
- using exampple from lecture
- shows IP address of where the other end is - in this case where the jokes are
- starts printing off the jokes
- underneath the counter - how many jokes are being told
- the number of jokes being said and the counter do not match
- the counter increases every time the draw function is called - jokes only update once every second (thats the 1000 in the setInterval function - line 10 and 12)
